# Hack Midwest 2025
::

<br/>

We assembled a team of 4 to join Hack Midwest for the first time. It was great time and we won Best Design. Our app is on Digital Carnival backed by Stablecoin. There were some hiccups on the event itself, but overall great time. I also saw Carl and Patrick. Both are great friends in tech communities.
