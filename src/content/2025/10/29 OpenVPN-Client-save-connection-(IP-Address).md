When I first used OpenVPN client, it was set up for me so I'm missing out on some configuration know how.

<br/>

And now I need to set up OpenVPN on a new computer and I need to save a connection so I can quickly connect to it the next time I log on. In this case, I'm using a v2.x.x OpenVPN client and I can't seem to figure out how to do that.

<br/>

It turns out that I have to be disconnected from all connections and then select `Import > From`{.bg-gray-200 .p-2 .rounded} server.... Then I can enter my connection information and it will be saved and easily accessible just by hovering over it and select Connect...
