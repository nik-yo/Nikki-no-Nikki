# Under $1 a month Hosting
::

<br />

This is probably one of my exciting finds from few years ago. At that time, I wanted to modernize my old personal site and not having to pay $12 a month for hosting. My requirements were cheap to host, using newer technology, and easy to maintain.

<br />

I started addressing the requirements one by one. Starting from cost, I found out that compute is expensive, so I need something that doesn't require much compute power. For website, the answer is static files, such as plain HTML, CSS, Javascript files.

<br />

But static files are hard to maintain. That's when newer technology helps. In this area, the answer is SPA (Single-Page Application). However, I need one that supports SSG (Static Site Generator). It means, the application will be transformed into static files.

<br />

Now, my old site has database. But I really only care about the data, so I decided to use JSON (Javascript Object Notation) files which can be easily parsed by SPA. That solves my data issue.

<br />

Finally hosting. The cheapest hosting I can find is $2-3 a month. So, I turned to cloud, in this case, I use AWS. With it, I can finally host my personal site under $1 a month. My October 2025 cost was only $0.53. And it's not only for 1 site, I have multiple sites hosted in AWS.
