# Exploring React Router v7
::

<br/>

Coming from React Router v6, the new version brings a lot of change. One of them is the various modes that we can use:

- Framework
- Data
- Declarative

<br/>

From all of them, seems like Framework mode is the recommended and most comprehensive, so I start with that. However, the documentation is a little confusing for me. To start with, the installation instruction begins with a template. In my case, I want to start from scratch and I found it under upgrading: [https://reactrouter.com/upgrading/component-routes]{.text-blue-600}. It is also to good to check the following page: [https://reactrouter.com/how-to/route-module-type-safety]{.text-blue-600}.

<br/>

In my case, I want to use layout and the following page is a great help: [https://reactrouter.com/start/framework/routing]{.text-blue-600}.

<br/>

When it finally works, I need to build the app. In my case, I want to use SSG, so I need to disable the SSR (Server Side Rendering) which is covered under: [https://reactrouter.com/how-to/spa]{.text-blue-600}.
